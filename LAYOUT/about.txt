Meet the Builder Behind FoundrFuse
Content:

Parth Pangtey, a serial entrepreneur and passionate technologist, faced the same bottleneck as many early-stage founders — hours of cold emails, no responses, and a lack of warm, timely connections with investors who actually cared.

So he built FoundrFuse — a platform inspired by real startup struggles, designed with empathy, and engineered for efficiency. It's not just a tool, it’s a movement to give every builder a fair shot at getting funded.

Startups Don't Need More Noise. They Need the Right Signal.

Traditional networking platforms are outdated, bloated, and biased towards already-funded players.

FoundrFuse levels the field with mutual swipe-based matching, AI-powered discovery, and transparent pitch verification — helping startups in Tier-2/3 cities get seen and investors discover hidden gems before anyone else.
